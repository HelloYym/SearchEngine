CD8 regulatory cells in immune regulation and development of autoimmune diseases', u'\uff1a', u' ', u'CD8+ regulatory T cells play key roles in maintaining self-tolerance. We have been focused on the study of Qa1-restricted CD8+ regulatory cells in mice. We have discovered that the suppressive activity of these regulatory cells was tightly regulated by the interaction of CD94/NKG2A and Qa1. Disruption of the CD94/NKG2A-Qa1 by either site-directed mutagenesis or antibody blockade enables the maximum release of CD8+ suppressive activity and amelioration of autoimmune diseases such as EAE in mice', u'\uff08', u'Lu et al. PNAS 2008', u'\uff09', u'\u3002', u'We have recently reported that Glatiramer acetate, a FDA proved anti-MS drug, was able to induce Qa1-resricted CD8+ regulatory cells in mice, which could be used for the treatment of autoimmune IBD', u'\uff08', u'Yao Y et al.

The regulation of phagocytes activation and inflammatory responses:', u' Phagocytes including macrophages form the first line of defense against microbe invaders by initiate inflammatory responses. We are interested in clarify the functions of molecules involved in this process. We\u2019ve identified several signaling molecules which might be involved in the regulation of macrophage activation. We have recently found that a Ras-related small G-protein could regulate LPS-induced inflammatory response through the regulation of surface TLR4 expression level. Rab10 is essential for promoting the trafficking of TLR4 molecules from ER to cytoplasmic membrane, thus to influence the response of the cell to LPS stimulation and the subsequent inflammatory response ', u'(Wang et al 2010)', u'.We are currently investigating a couple of other molecules which are involved in the regulation of phagocyte activation.', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'Fig. 2.

By using the data-mining tool ', u'cDNA Digital Gene Expression Displayer (DGED)', u' ', u', we identified a gene encodes an uncharacterized protein, which is preferentially expressed in T-lineage cells. We constructed the knockout mice of this gene and found out that it led to decreased numbers of mature thymic CD4 and CD8 T cells, reflecting impaired thymocyte development. Further analysis revealed that this molecule associates with TCR signaling components PLC-', u'g', u'1 and Grb2, and contributes to the activation of ', u'the Erk/AP-1 and Ca', u'2+', u'/NFAT pathways upon TCR engagement. This molecule was renamed by our group as Tespa1 (for Thymocyte expressed, positive selection associated 1) ', u'(Wang et al. Nature Immunology 2012)', u'. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms how Tespa1 regulates TCR signaling and further explore its roles in mediating signaling pathways in other immune cells like B cells and mast cells.
