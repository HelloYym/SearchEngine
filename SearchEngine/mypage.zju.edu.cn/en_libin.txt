In particular, I am very interested in the bacterial genomics, proteome and transcriptome and specific gene function such as genes involved in VI secretion system. Also, we focus on the pathogenic mechnism of some important plant bacteria and the antibacterial actions of mode of either antagonistic bacteria or chemicals such as chitosan against a variety of plant pathogens. In addition, I am also interested in the interaction between rice pathogenic bacteria and its phage or rice plants.
