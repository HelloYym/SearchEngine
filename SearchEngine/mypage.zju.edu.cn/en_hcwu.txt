Wu was born in Shanxi, China in 1980. Since Jan. 2013, he has been a  full professor at the Institute for Fusion Theory and Simulation,  Zhejiang University (IFTS-ZJU), Hangzhou, China, where he heads a  research group on ultrafast high-field physics and nuclear fusion. He  received undergraduate physics education at the Shanxi University, and  obtained a PhD degree from the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of  Sciences (IOP-CAS) in 2006. The PhD thesis won the Tsai-Shi-Dong Plasma  Physics Award. He did postdoctoral research at the Max-Planck-Institute  for Quantum Optics (MPQ) as a Humboldt Fellow, as well as the Los Alamos  National Laboratory (LANL). His current research interests include  novel radiation sources, particle acceleration from relativistic  laser-plasma interactions, and controlled nuclear fusion.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Laser-plasma interactions, high energy density physics, nuclear fusion etc.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':IFTS-ZJU', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/hcwu'}
