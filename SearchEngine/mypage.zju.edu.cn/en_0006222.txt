Her research interests focus on lactation biology and dairy production. In lactation biology, she is currently focusing on understanding the lactation mechanism, the nutritional manipulation of milk protein, fat and fatty acids and their molecular and cellular mechanisms. In dairy production, she is interested in the protection of critical nutrients from rumen degradation by encapsulation, and their application in dairy cows. She has led several national and international projects, including projects on uptake and utilization mechanisms of limiting amino acids-containing small peptides in bovine mammary gland, nutrient requirement for replacement cattle and intensive feeding techniques, mechanism of glucose uptake and regulation in bovine mammary epithelial cells and their effects on milk composition, effects of methionine, lysine and its ratio on milk protein synthesis, preparation of rumen-protected functional amino acids and its application in dairy cows. Dr. Liu is an author of more than 50 articles, and has presented papers at many national and international conferences. Her awards include the excellent teacher prize by Zhejiang University, the distinguished young scholar prize by Zhejiang University, the 10 best young innovators prize by Zhejiang University, the foster qualified scientist for national dairy cows industrial technological system, the financial assistance by the China Scholarship Council, excellent teacher prize by Zhejiang University, distinguished youth teacher prize by Zhejiang University and outstanding graduate of Zhejiang Province by Department of Education of Zhejiang Province.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Lactation Biology, Manipulation of milk secretion\r\nResearch is focused on lactation physiology, nutrients uptake and utilization in mammary gland, and regulation of milk composition and production.\r\n', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:+86 571 8898 2965', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:hyliu@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Zhejiang University, College of Animal Sciences', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/0006222'}
