I realized more clearly the importance of overcoming different levels\u2019 barriers when I began the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the community in 2003. We tried to provide psychological support for victims of a major fire. After two years of study I had developed a clear picture of the barriers for the mental health delivery in the community. I also learned something about community collaborations in China. With my increasing interest in the delivery of mental health in community, and an understanding that geriatric depression was becoming a major public health problem in China and worldwide, I went to the Department of Psychiatry of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) as a postdoctoral fellow to continue research training. Professor Eric Caine, M.D., and Professor Helen Chiu, M.D., gave me the precious opportunity to visit University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) as an ICOHRTA postdoctoral fellow in the summer of 2007. I completed a one-year postdoctoral training in Rochester under the mentorship of Professor Yeates Conwell, with special emphasis on the theoretical groundwork and research methodology for studying collaborative care approaches to detection and treatment of late life depression. During my stay in Rochester, I took coursework on Aging and Public Health, Risk Adjustment, Research Methodology and Research Ethics, and grant writing. I also participated in laboratory meetings and worked closely with Professor Conwell on the development of a theoretical framework of the collaborative care approach to late life depression in Chinese primary care clinics. We were intrigued whether the evidenced-based collaborative care model can be translated into the Chinese primary care system. We obtained pilot data and, on that basis, I was awarded an R01 grant from the NIH Fogarty Center to examine the effectiveness of the intervention on late life depression in urban clinics. I am ', u'establishing ', u'connections with health and aging services administrations in Zhejiang and at the central government level, policy makers in China; geriatric psychiatry and health services research as emerging areas; and about the importance that the government is placing in primary care as the site for chronic disease management. As an emerging leader in geriatric mental health services research in China, I am well positioned to conduct the COACH study, and equally importantly, to use its findings to influence the development of policy concerning design and delivery of rural mental health care for the large and rapidly growing population of older adults in China.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Geriatric Mental Health', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:chenshulin@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/chenshulin'}
