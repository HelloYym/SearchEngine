Wei Li came to the United States in 1992 to have obtained MS and Ph.D. with Prof. Ralph L. Webb in Heat Transfer in the Pennsylvania State University in 1998. After he worked in the industry in the United States for eight years, he was hired as a full professor in the Department of Energy Engineering (ZJU) in 2006. His correlations have been included in the Section of Two-Phase flow of "2013 ASHRAE Handbook - Fundamentals". \r\n\r\nDr. Wei Li\u2019s research in enhanced heat transfer has been focused on optimizing the heat transfer performance of heat exchangers including advanced fin geometries, internal tube roughness, and other techniques suitable from-scratch designs as well as in-service equipment. He was involved in experimental, numerical, and theoretical aspects of micro-scale heat and mass process.  He published over 110 journal papers and conference papers.Dr. Li is recognized as an international leader in miro-enhanced heat transfer. He made presentations and seminars at dozens of top universities in China, and MIT, Stanford, University of Maryland, Penn State, University of Houston, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, University of Toronto, and so on in recent years. Especially, he was invited to be a plenary speaker to deliver a conference keynote twice at the 2007 and 2009 Chinese National Heat Transfer Conference, respectively.His Master graduate obtained full scholarship and continued Ph.D. study in Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT in US; His Doctor graduate obtained a faculty offer as assistant professor in Department of Energy Engineering at Lund University in Sweden. He has been a regional editor - Journal of Enhanced Heat Transfer since 2007.\r\n Journal papers published in 2010:\r\n', u'[1]Wei Li, Wave surface of boundary layer, Experimental Thermal and FluidScience, Volume 34, Issue 7, October 2010, Pages 838-844', u'\r\n', u'[2]Wei Li, Zan Wu, A general correlation for evaporative heat transfer inmicro/mini-channels, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume53, Issues 9-10, April 2010, Pages 1778-1787', u'\r\n', u'[3]Wei Li, Zan Wu A general criterion for evaporative heat transfer inmicro/mini-channels, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume53, Issues 9-10, April 2010, Pages 1967-1976.', u'\r\n', u'[4]Wei Li, Zan Wu, A general correlations for adiabatic two-phase pressuredrop in micro/mini-channels, International Journal of Heat and MassTransfer, Volume 53, Issues 13-14, June 2010, Pages 2732-2739\u3002[', u'\r\n', u'5]Wei Li, Quanqiu Li, Modeling Cooling Tower Fouling in Helical-Rib Tubesbased on Von-Karman Analogy, International Journal of Heat and MassTransfer, Volume 53, Issues 13-14, June 2010, Pages 2715-2721.', u'\r\n', u'[6]Wei Li, Xialing Wang, Heat transfer and pressure drop correlations forthe multi-region louver fin compact heat exchangers, International Journalof Heat and Mass Transfer, Volume 53, Issues 15-16, July 2010, Pages2955-2962', u'\r\n', u'[7] Wei Li, Zhike, Wang, Zan Wu, Generalized adiabatic pressure dropcorrelations in evaporative micro/mini-channels, Experimental Thermal andFluid Science, 2010, (in press)', u'\r\n', u'[8] Wei Li, Quanqiu Li, Modeling Cooling Tower Fouling in Enhanced Tubesbased on Prantl Analogy, Journal of Enhanced Heat Transfer, 2010.
