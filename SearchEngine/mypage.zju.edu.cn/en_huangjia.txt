Their corresponding receptors are important and potential targets for insecticides due to the differences in pharmacology profiles from their mammalian counterparts. However, genuine physiological or biochemical functions can be assigned to very few of above receptors. With approaches of molecular biology, pharmacology, electrophysiology and neurobiology, we want to find out the specific roles of these receptors in vivo and develop cell-based assays for neuroreceptor-targeted insecticides. Besides, we are also interested in the mode of actions of novel insecticides such as tetronic acid and diamide insecticides on pests and parasitoids. Furthermore, we aimed to figure out the interactions between the nervous and immune systems in insects.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:+86-571-86971625', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:huangj@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Institute of Insect Sciences', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/huangjia'}
