Since ocean acidification is a research topic with only about 10 years\u2019 history, many research works are needed to be carried out including the effect and mechanism of ocean acidification on fertilization kinetics and embryo development of marine shellfish such as blood clam (Tegillarca granosa), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), and razor clam (Sinonovacula constricta). Those shellfish live in the coastal intertidal zone facing the most severe anthropogenic CO2 release and their spawning season which is in summer overlaps with CO2 temporal distribution peak. Therefore, those species are under tremendous ocean acidification threaten. One of my research topics focuses on the effect of ocean acidification on the fertilization and early embryo development of those intertidal shellfish. Our results will help to expend the scope of ocean acidification research, to fill the gaps in affecting mechanism of ocean acidification on fertilization kinetics and embryo development, to provide the experimental data for aquaculture industry to choose strategy dealing with coming ocean acidification, and to give guidance to ecosystem restoration in acidification coastal areas.\r\n\r\n(2) In the past 30 years, the average air temperature of Chinese coast raised 1.1\xbaC, the water temperature of sea surface increased 0.9\xbaC and the sea level rose 90mm; these increase rates are slightly higher than those of the global averages. \u201cChina\u2019s National Plan 2007 to adapt to climate changes\u201d pointed out that \u201cClimate change has already shown its influence on China\u2019s coastal environment and ecosystems, such as the trend of accelerating sea level rise, the subsequently coastal erosion, seawater intrusion and ecosystem degradation\u201d. In order to estimate the plasticity of coastal ecosystem to adapt to climate change, another research interest is to reveal how climate change affects the shellfish population and to understand the adaptation mechanism of some shellfish species. \r\n\r\n(3) With climate change and ocean acidification, anthropogenic pollutants such as heavy metals may show changes in their toxicity to marine organisms. This combined effects of climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution may pose great threaten to the shellfish aquiculture industry along Pacific coast. Therefore, we are also interested in the ecotoxicology of anthropogenic pollutants on coastal shellfish populations.\r\n', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:+86-571-88982636', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:guangxu_liu@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/guangxu_liu'}
