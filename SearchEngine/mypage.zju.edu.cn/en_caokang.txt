I have majored in urban planning, architecture design and human geography. Learning experiences in these different fields allowing me to understand urban planning better, both from macro- and micro-perspectives.\xa0I combine my\xa0personal interests in history, philosophy and archaeology with my major, and finally have planning theory and planning history as\xa0my research interests.', u'\r\n', u"As for planning theory, I have studied the development of modern planning theory in the last 2 centuries in my doctoral dissertation. I believe this sets a stage for a deeper theoretical research for me. I\xa0suppose that one can\xa0trace the development of modern planning theory both from a chronological order and from an internal logic, such as philosophical traditions, ontology and epistemology, etc. This is what I'm\xa0at present\xa0concerning and working with. Structuralism, positivism, \xa0pragmatism, rationalism... how do these affect planning theory? I wonder. Besides this, I think there are pairs or groups of concepts in planning theory debate such as public and private; left and right; late-, post- and neo-; class, race and\xa0gender that await us to\xa0argue.", u'\r\n', u"I have turned my interests to planning history in ancient time, and of the western world in modern times, from the industrial revolution to the present time as I was\xa0engaged in\xa0postdoctoral work\xa0at BNU. I especially curious about how cities evolve from primary settlements or proto-urban settlements, and\xa0believe that agriculture, trade, religion and military could all be possible factors for origins of cities. Another focus of my planning historical study is the modern western planning history. My post-doc report mainly discusses\xa0how western urban and regional planning practices go ahead after 1945. I've also written a book named ", u'A Brief History of Modern Western Urban Planning', u" which is published in Southeast University Press in 2010. Hope one day I could delete the word 'brief' in the title.", u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'My research mainly concerns philosophical tradition and evolvement mechanism of planning theory, and western planning history in ancient time and since the 19th century.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:k_cao@126.com', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Department of Regional and Urban Planning', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/caokang'}
