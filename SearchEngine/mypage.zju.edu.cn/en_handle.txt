We have elucidated the underlying causes of endangerment of these species, and developed conservation strategies for them. In addition, a software was developed (PGDC 1.0) which assists in constructing core collections of endangered species based on their among-population allele frequency distributions. The above research findings have been published in a variety of high quality international journals, including American Journal of Botany, Conservation Genetics, and Planta Medica. Since 2004, two prizes for research achievements were awarded to me: the Second Prize for Scientific and Technological Advancement of Zhejiang Province (Dec. 2008) and the Third Prize for Scientific and Technological Advancement of Zhejiang Province (Dec. 2004).\r\n\r\n(2) MOLECULAR PHYLOGEOGRAPHY OF TEMPERATE PLANT ENDEMICS IN EAST ASIA \u2013 Based on our phylogeographical studies of several East Asian plant endemics restricted to temperate-deciduous forests, we conclude that (i) components of this forest type in South Japan and East China were particularly sensitive to range fragmentation, isolation, and enhanced (incipient) species formation throughout the glacial and interglacial periods of the (Late) Quaternary and (ii) the current distribution and differentiation of components of presently isolated warm temperate-deciduous forests in East China, South Japan and South Korea likely resulted from a combination of relatively ancient vicariant and immigration events (e.g., from South Japan to East China), at least pre-dating the last glacial/interglacial cycle of land-bridge formation and disruption across the East China Sea.\r\n', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone: Phone:++86-0571-88981703; Fax: ++86-0571-86432273', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:qyxhero@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Laboratory of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/handle'}
