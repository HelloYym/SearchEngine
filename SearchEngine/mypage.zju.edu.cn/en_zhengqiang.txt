As an assistant engineer, he did research on synthesis and modification of silicon rubber materials at The Chenguang Research Institute of Chengguang Chemical Industry, China, from 1982 to 1985. He got master degree at Department of Polymer Materials & Engineering, Chengdu University of Science and Technology(CUST) in 1988 and then joined the Polymer Research Institute of CUST. After finished his PhD courses in CUST, he went to Kyoto University to continue his PhD program from 1992 to 1994. He got PhD degree at Polymer Research Institute of Sichuan University in the end of 1994. He became a associate professor and a full professor in 1995 and 1998 respectively, in the Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University. He teaches two master and doctor courses related to polymer structure & properties and polymer rheology and is the tutor for the PhD and MSc degrees in polymer materials & polymer processing, respectively.', u'\r\n', u'His research interests are in the polymer rheology, structure-properties relationship for multi-component polymeric materials and functional polymeric materials. Especially the relationship between special dynamic viscoelastical behavior at low frequencies (long time region) and phase \u2013 separation, rheological behavior and functional properties are his representative research subjects. He got a lot of honour and awards including National Science Founds for Distinguished Young Scholars in 2001 and Chang Jiang (Cheung Kong) Scholars in 2004. Besides, he holds a lot of posts concurrently including the member of Science-technology Committee of National Education Department, the member of council of Chemistry Society, China, the member of Polymer Science Committee of China and member of Rheology Association of China. And he is also at the editorial board of Chinese famous academy periodicals such as', u' Chinese Science Bulletin', u', ', u'Chinese Journal of Polymer Science,', u' Chinese Journal of Applied Chemistry,', u' ', u'Functional Material, Journal of Materials Science and Engineering, Polymer Bulletin', u', ', u'China Plastics Industry', u'. Recently he became the regional editor of ', u'The Journal of the Society of Rheology. Japan', u'. Up to now, he has published 220 papers in international journals such as', u' Macromolecular, Polymer, Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Physics: Part B, Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics,', u' Chinese J.
