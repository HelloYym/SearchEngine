All the while, new polymeric membranes and separation technologies (including membrane bioreactor and contactor) are still in investigation for separation process in more atrocious condition. Besides, functional moieties contained polyimides and polyimide nano materials are investigated too for their potential applications as information materials. From these works, eighty-five papers have been published and fifteen patents have been filed. The related outstanding achievements were awarded as several rewards, including one National Innovation Reward and one United Nation Reward.
