The main innovative achievements are as follows:\r\n1) A kind of simple ammonium ILs with low cost, easy preparation, and excellent performance were prepared, and applied in the cracking, hydrolyzing, and condensing reaction as dual solvent-catalyst. The results showed that catalytic activity was significantly influenced by the acidity of these protic ILs. The industrial application of these simple ammonium ILs was successful for the production of cinnamic acid (1000t/y) and 2-alkylpropene (1000t/y). National award for technological invention 2nd prize (in publicity), Ministry of education science and technology progress award 2nd prize, and Zhejiang provincial science and technology award 2nd prize were awarded. \r\n2) Some novel systems for CO2 and SO2 capture by ILs were developed. For example, a kind of anion-functionalized protic ILs were designed and used for CO2 capture for the first time. The results showed that equimolar CO2 capture could be achieved due to the reactivity of the anion, and the absorption and desorption of CO2 could be easily tuned by the basicity of these ILs. \r\n', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:87952424', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:chewcm@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/congminwang'}
