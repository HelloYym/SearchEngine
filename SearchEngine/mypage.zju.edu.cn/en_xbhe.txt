It is most famous as the birthplace of China's former paramount learder Deng Xiaoping. Besides Guang'an, I have been living in the city of Xuzhou, Beijing, Seoul, New Haven, Houston, and now I am in Hangzhou, a very beautiful city. From the summer of next year (2015), I will be moving to an island Zhoushan.", u'\r\n', u'I obtained my Ph.D degree in solid geophysics (earthquake seismology) in 2008 from university of chinese academy of sciences. Before I joined the department of marine sciences, Zhejiang university, as a new faculty in October 2014, \xa0I had postdoc experience at Yonsei and Yale.', u'\r\n', u"I am a seismologist to determine the seismic structure of the Earth's interior for understanding its chemical composition and dynamic processes by analyzing seismic phases. Particularly, I am interested in constraining the seismic anisotropy, the directional and polarizational dependence of seismic wave speeds, which is a consequence of strain-induced lattice-preferred orientation of mineral in the Earth's mantle. Measurement of seismic anisotropy represents perhaps the best tool available to directly probe the past and present patterns of deformation at depth. To get better understanding of the Earth interal structure and dynamics, I also incorporate seismic results with constraints from other Earth science fields, like geodynamics and mineral physics.", u'\r\n', u'\xa0', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'seismic anisotropy and mantle dynamics, mantle heterogeneity, seismic discontinuities, mantle water cycle, intraplate magmatism, tectonics (orogen and rift), crustal structure, regional seismicity, seismic phase identification', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:xbhe@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Department of Marine Sciences, Ocean College, Zhejiang University', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/xbhe'}
