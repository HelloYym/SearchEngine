He received his bachelor and master degrees in computer science and technology from Zhejiang University in 1989 and 1992, respectively. And he received his PhD in computer application from Zhejiang University in 1995. After that, he was promoted as an associate professor as well as professor and doctoral supervisor in 1997 and 2005, respectively. Meanwhile, he teaches four major courses for both undergraduate and graduate students. And he also research on the fields like artificial intelligence, novel network architecture and network QoS for a long time. In recent years, his research subjects are mainly on the network virtualization as well as the reconfigurable and flexible network technology. He presided over and was involved in a number of the research projects including the 973 Program, National Nature \xa0Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the 863 Program as well as the National R&D Infrastructure and Facility Development Program of China. He is currently a fostering candidate of \u201cNew Century 151 Talents Engineering\u201d in Zhejiang province, academic youth\u2019s leader of Zhejiang University, a senior member of the electronic committee of China as well as an editor of \u201cChinese journal of electronics\u201d.', u'\r\n', u'\r\nIn recent years, he leads the lab team to research on the prospective area of the new generation high trustworthy Internet architecture, having proposed the innovative idea of the hierarchized network operation provision. Such idea turns the tight coupling between network operations and services into the loose one, so that it deciphers the mismatching problems between the service requirements and provisions in the current Internet, so as to greatly strengthen extensibility of the network capability provisions. The idea has been adopted into the research of the special project, \u201ccomponent R&D in the reconfigurable router\u201d, of the 863 program, \u201cNew Generation High-trustworthy Networks\u201d, so as to realize precise and adoptable management and control of network resources. The project has built a reconfigurable and flexible testbed that orients three features: (1) the capability of converging the triple networks, (2) the new network architecture and mechanisms, and (3) the service provision. Based on the project, he further researches in depth on the intelligent techniques in the area of the network recognition. And he is in charge of researching on the project, \u201cself-adoptive cognitive service provision mechanism\u201d, of the 973 program, \u201creconfigurable information and communication fundamental network architecture and systems\u201d. Based on the project, he proposes to research on the cognition problem in three aspects, namely, the service cognition, the resource sensing and the intelligent adoption. The research is to realize high-efficient utilization of the network resources on the premise of filling with users\u2019 requirements for services. He leads the lab team to research on \u201cSoftware-Defined Networks (SDN)\u201d recognized as an important research field among the international academic circle. For SDN, the team has proposed the novel network architecture and several key techniques of supporting platform in the control plane, in order to improve the programmability and evolvability of the current Internet architecture.', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'    His research results have been published as more than 70 papers on a number of Chinese and international magazines, journals as well as conferences, such as \u201cIEEE Communications Magazine\u201d, \u201cComputer Networks\u201d, \u201cINFOCOM\u201d, \u201cONS\u201d, \u201cICC\u201d, \u201dIET Electronics Letters\u201d, \u201dIET Proc. Communications\u201d, \u201dGLOBECOM\u201d, \u201dChinese Journal of Electronics\u201d, \u201cChina Science\u201d, etc. His publications include 50 papers cited by SCI or EI, two books and 20 national patents. In Apr. 2012, the work, \u201cXFlow: Component-based Reconfigurable Network Architecture\u201d, of which he is responsible for research and development was shortlisted for demonstration in the first session of global-scale Open Networking Summit sponsored by Open Networking Foundation (ONF). In this summit, Zhejiang University is the only Chinese university invited by ONF.  In 2004, the Chinese government honored him with the first-class National Scientific and Technological Progress Award. In 2014, owing to significant research achievements in reconfigurable network, ', u'the Chinese government honored him with the second-class National Scientific and Technological Progress Award again.
