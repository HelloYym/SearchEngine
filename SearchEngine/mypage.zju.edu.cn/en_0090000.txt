In 2003 she got PhD degree majored in Crop Science (Plant Abiotic Stress Physiology). She was a visiting scholar in Agriculture Centre of Egypt from October 1997 to May 1998, a senior visiting scholar at John Innes Centre during Mach-May 2000, and at the University of Glasgow in Mach-May 2002 and July- September 2003, a visiting Professor in The University of Sydney in July-September 2007, and at the University of Western Sydney in June-July 2013. Her main research interest is evaluation and identification of plant germplasm, mainly in barley, resistant to abiotic stresses and its molecular physiology, and phytoremediation of metal-contaminated environments and safe crop production.
