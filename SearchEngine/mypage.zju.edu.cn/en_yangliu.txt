From 1999 to 2002, I was a research assistant in the Beckman Institute at UIUC under the supervision of ', u'Prof. Karl Hess', u', where my work was on the simulation of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) based on a comprehensive laser diode simulator MINILASE. From 2003 to 2013, I worked firstly as a Research Associate and then as a Consulting Associate Professor in ', u'Prof. Robert Dutton', u'\u2019s ', u'Stanford TCAD', u' group. My research interests include the design and simulation of novel biosensors, digital/analog electronic devices and optoelectronic devices such as LEDs and laser diodes. The platform of my simulation work is a general Partial Differential Equation solver, ', u'PROPHET', u". I also enjoyed being a lecturer for Stanford undergrad course EE116 \u201cSemiconductor Device Physics\u201d from 2011 to 2013.
