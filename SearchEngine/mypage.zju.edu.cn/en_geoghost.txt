(Shanghai), I returned to school in October 2011, and became a post-doctorial research fellow and then an assistant professor\xa0in Department of Earch Sciences, Zhejiang Univerisity.

In recent years, I pay much attention to the growth of the Tibetan Plateau, and focus mainly on the Altyn Tagh Fault, one of the most important strike-slip faults in the plateau, and the Qaidam Basin, the largest sedimentary basin inside the plateau. I attempt to establish a tectonic- to- sedimentary link between the two tectonic units through work of our team, and some meaningful progress has already been obtained.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:+86-571-87952791', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:wulei@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/geoghost'}
