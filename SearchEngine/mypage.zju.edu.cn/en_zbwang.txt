Their results were published in many well-known journals (ca. 20 papers). We have demonstrated that crystal orientation control in a continuous MFI film can be achieved by simple adjustment of synthesis compositions and synthesis conditions using direct in situ crystallization (', u'@', u'\u201cChemistry of Materials\u201d and \u201cMicroporous and Mesoporous Materials\u201d). b-oriented films obtained are particularly promising for many new applications including chemical sensors, membrane separation and as low-k dielectrics. Continuous zeolite thin films can also be obtained by spin-on of zeolite nanocrystal suspension, and these films have shown their potential as low-k dielectrics for the first time in the world. We have published two papers in \u201cAdvanced Materials\u201d about zeolite thin films as low-k dielectrics, and these two papers have been cited by many researchers (more than 90 times) including famous groups in the world (Prof. M.E. Davis, Prof. M. Tsapatsis and so on). We have also shown that zeolite coatings can be used as corrosion-resistant coatings on aluminum alloys (@ \u201cElectrochem. & ', u'Solid', u' ', u'State', u' Lett.\u201d). We have also demonstrated that complex porous architectures such as micropatterned zeolite thin films, micro-macroporous zeolite structures, self-standing zeolite membranes, can be fabricated by using zeolite nanocrystals as \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d throuth a novel, convenient, and versatile materials-processing approach (@ \u201cJ. Am. Chem. Soc.\u201d). This paper has been cited more than 108 times. Our three ', u'US', u' patents have been granted.
