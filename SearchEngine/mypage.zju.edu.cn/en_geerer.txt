But as 'philosophers' in China are\xa0not really doing anything philosophically,\xa0I doubt that you really like me to call you 'philosopher', if you are a Chinese scholar and want to do some real philosophy. Anyway, welcome to my page and blog, especially those people who are eager to do some real philosophy.", u'\r\n', u'Okay, so what is\xa0the real philosophy? I would like to quote Armstrong here: "\xa0the central task of philosophy is to give an account, or at least play a part in giving an account, of the most general nature of things and of man." Another purpose of quoting Armstrong is to clarify some confusion people have on analytic philosophy, as this is a view about philosophy that is accepted by many analytic philosophers, at least according to Armstrong. Just as Armstrong\xa0would include himself\xa0among that many, so\xa0would I.\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'\r\n', u'Then as an analytic philosopher, what\xa0am I doing right now? Currently I am working on philosophy of mind, especially about\xa0the debate between physicalism and anti-physicalism. I am not yet able to\xa0give an account of the nature of consciousness and other things related to it,\xa0but I do believe that\xa0I am playing a part\xa0in doing so by contributing some (hopefully useful)\xa0crticisms, comments, and discussions to the field. My long goal, surely, would be to\xa0give an account or a rough one of my own on something that is big\xa0for philosophy.\xa0\xa0', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'AOS: Philosophy of Mind, Epistemology\r\nAOC: Philosophy of Language, Modern Philosophy', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Philosophy Department', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/geerer'}
