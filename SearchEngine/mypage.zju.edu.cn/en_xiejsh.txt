The crux is that the researchers who work in it, after a fixing thinking, are keen to look for evidence from Pala, or the texts by great masters such as Atisa. Perhaps we have a misunderstanding to the situation of Tibetan art from the 11th to 13th century. In which we confirmed that the rise of the art in phyir-dar was stimulated by Pala art, all the appearance of the style also supported our estimation. \xa0In 2015, I hope to finished my research on Drathang murals, which will interpret why the opinion originate.\xa0', u'\r\n', u'By the way, on Oct 16 to 20, 2015 we will hold the Sixth International Conference on Tibetan Archaeology and Arts in Zhejiang University.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Teaching & research in both Tibetan and Han-Chinese art history.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:xiejisheng@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Zhejiang University Center for Buddhist Art', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/xiejsh'}
