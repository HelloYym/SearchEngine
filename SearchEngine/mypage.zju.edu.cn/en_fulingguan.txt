She is mainly engaged in spatial structure and aerospace structure research. She is one of the first advocates of space deployable structure in China and now is professor and doctoral tutor in spatial structure research center of College of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Zhejiang University.', u'\r\n', u'\xa0', u'\r\n', u'Main study and work experience', u'\r\n', u'Graduated from radar technology department of the university of xi\u2019an electronic science and technology in 1968. From 1978 to 1981, she studied for master degree in the university of xi\u2019an electronic science and technology. From 1982 to 1986, she worked as a lecturer in Hangzhou electronic industrial institute. From 1986 to 1990, she studied in the university of Tokyo as the Chinese government sent researcher. Japanese expert advisor is famous spatial structure expert: professor hangayi. During this period, 20 articles were published. In 1989 gained the doctoral degree of Tokyo university. During this period, worked in Japan ZhuZhongGongWu technology institute for a year funded by the Japanese overseas technology academic center. In April 1990 she returned as the dean and the associate professors of Hangzhou electronic industrial institute mechanics department. In 1993 as zhejiang university professor, deputy dean of civil engineering and doctoral tutor. From 1997 to 1998, as let guest member professor in deep space exploration department of Japan cosmic science institute. Since 1998 as professor and tutor in the research center of spatial structure of zhejiang university. During this period, as deputy director of the research center of spatial structure.', u'\r\n', u'\xa0', u'\r\n', u'Research work field', u'\r\n', u'The main research direction is structural engineering. after returning home in 19 90, publicity and research of spatial ', u'deployable ', u'structure, such as large ', u'deployable', u' antenna, the sun panels, space station, etc. in Ground architecture field, early studies of membrane structure, large roofing structure, etc. Since 1992 started to take three national natural science fund, two following cross-industry fund, an electrical science college fund, two 863-2 project, an assembly pre-research foundation and two assembly pre-research item. There are many research tasks from 509, 813, 504 institute of Aerospace science and technology and 39 institute of Electronic science and technology etc. And guide 24 doctoral post graduates and 40 master graduate students.', u'\r\n', u'In recent years, spatial ', u'deployable', u' antenna structure are systematically analyzed and researched in details and a series of major breakthrough are obtained. Theoretical results are included in the following aspects:', u'\r\n', u'1, space structure analysis method with displacement constraints is proposed, displacement constraints of structural stress analysis is solved by Butt-Daffin generalized inverse matrix.', u'\r\n', u'2, Based on the basic theory of type design , displacement requirements are defined as the constraint condition of shape design. Differential form \xa0of the generalized inverse matrix Moore \u2013 Penrose is deduced for the first time, And is applied to inverse analysis for structure.', u'\r\n', u'3, Deployable dynamic analysis theory is proposed. the movement process from unstable structure to the stable state is analyzed by application of the generalized inverse theory. Optimization folding pattern and control theory are proposed. provide analysis method from geometry variable systems to the defined form and its corresponding control determination is provided. The unstable structure problem and nonlinear analysis problems are settled by generalized inverse matrix methods satisfactorily .', u'\r\n', u'4, Stability problem of structure is analyzed by generalized incremental method', u'\r\n', u'5, The structure deformation and electromagnetic interaction problem of large reflective surface antenna, also have be solved to make great progress.', u'\r\n', u'According to project 863-2, two of 5 meters paraboloid deployable antenna models were designed cleverly and tested repeatedly. The model unit structure, joint structure and the overall structure were finished various optimization design. Two deployable antenna model not only have light weight, and with high reflective accuracy.', u'\r\n', u'Following aspects have achieved remarkable results in Civil engineering field: retractable roof structure is designed and analyzed. System engineering including mechanical, electronic, structure were studied. The sports center tennis retractable roof was designed. Cable-membrane structures: A analysis software, from looking for shape, load analysis, cutting to the node design was developed. Design analysis of a number of membrane structure engineering. Steel structure: stadium roof design, the bridge structure construction control and wind tunnel test of bridges, etc.', u'\r\n', u'Cable-strut mast, and other space structure microgravity experimental platform were established. A non-contact measurement system has been established based on PhotoModeler software, which can realize non-contact measurement of inflatable deployable structure for deploy process and reflective surface accuracy.', u'\r\n', u'\xa0', u'\r\n', u'Abroad academic exchange activities are conducted widely and we have close cooperation with experts from American JPL, California institute of technology, UCLA, Japan FengQiao technology university, Japan Nagoya university and Tokyo university.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'spatial structure,deployable structure, antenna structure', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:086-0571-87951347', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/fulingguan'}
