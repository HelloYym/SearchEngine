He gained his PhD (1996) and MSc (1993) in composite materials in Harbin Institute of Technology and BEng (1990) in Zhejiang University. He was a full Professor in the Advanced Composites Centre for Innovation and Science (ACCIS) in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Bristol University (member of Worldwide University Network and ranked 29th in the recent QS World University Rankings) and worked as a Research Fellow in the Materials Department at Oxford University and Brunel University. He also served as the Deputy Director of the Bristol Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information \uff08NSQI\uff09and a member of the Senate.', u'\r\n', u'His research activities follow two main streams: (1): Nanomaterial through Engineering to Applications; and (2) Novel Composites and Microstructures. The latter involves (i) development of ferromagnetic microwire (meta-) composites for a range of innovative engineering applications such as structural health monitoring; (ii) hierarchical approach to composites microstructures; and (iii) novel applications of actuating shape memory materials. He has published over 120 peer reviewed Journal articles including three authoritative monographs in Progress in Materials Science. He has been invited to give Plenary/Keynote/Invited talks at over 20 international conferences/workshops and involved in organizing major international conferences including ICCM.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Aerospace materials and composites;\r\nFerromagnetic microwire composites;\r\nNanocomposite coatings;\r\nMetal-ceramic composites;\r\nMicrostructural design.    \r\n\r\nPublications:\r\nhttp://seis.bris.ac.uk/~aehxp/Publications.html\r\n', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:+86-571-87952660', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:hxpengwork@gmail.com; hxpengwork@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Zhejiang University', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/hxpengwork'}
