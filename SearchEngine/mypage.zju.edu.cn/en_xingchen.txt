A part of my research is to collaborate with hospitals to carry out both prospective and case-control studies often on a large-scale. We currently have conducted a research on lung cancer screening combining breath detection with computed tomography detection. Another part of my research focus on the realization and optimization of detection technologies into designed medical instruments or devices. We have collaborated with clinicians to target the developing requirements and conducted clinical trials to verify the utility of the devices.
