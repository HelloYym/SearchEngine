I would like to quote Armstrong here: "\xa0the central task of philosophy is to give an account, or at least play a part in giving an account, of the most general nature of things and of man." Another purpose of quoting Armstrong is to clarify some confusion people have on analytic philosophy, as this is a view about philosophy that is accepted by many analytic philosophers, at least according to Armstrong. Just as Armstrong\xa0would include himself\xa0among that many, so\xa0would I.\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'\r\n', u'Then as an analytic philosopher, what\xa0am I doing right now?
