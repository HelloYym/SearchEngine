He was invited to review manuscripts for various\xa0 journals and conferences including International Journal of Engineering, Science and Technology, Chinese Journal of Medical Instrumentation, Chinese Journal of Biomedical Engineering, International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering.\xa0 ', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'Teaching Experience: ', u'\r\n', u'Principle of Database System, Undergraduate course, 2004-2007, 48 hours/year', u'\r\n', u'Basics of Computer Software Technologies, Undergraduate course, 2008-2010, 80 hours/year ', u'\r\n', u'Overview of Medical Informatics, Graduate course 2004-2010, 32 hours/year', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\r\n', u'Achievement', u's', u'\r\n', u'Combining techniques of business process management with medical intelligence. ', u'Since 2007, Dr. Lu has focused on using his expertise in medical intelligence to improve clinical process management through two BB projects cooperating among tri-parties of Philips, TU/e, and ZJU. From 2007 to 2010, as the project leader, Dr. Lu studied methodologies of improving healthcare processes using the YAWL and ProM toolkits. The project was well managed and an exchange Ph.D student accomplished his task of transferring knowledge from China to Europe and vice versa. Over 10 international journal and conference papers have been published and one successful case study in Chinese hospital is conducted. A new BBP project of \u201cA process analysis and process mining toolkit for clinical pathway management\u201d was initiated from 06/2011 and taken as the continuation of the previous one, to further improve the cooperation and knowledge transfer.', u'\r\n', u'Development of Guideline-based ', u'Clinical Decision Support System. ', u'From Jan. 2007 to Dec. 2008, Dr. Lu was in charge of developing Guideline-based CDSS funded by the \u201c863\u201d Program in China. An integrated methodology of knowledge modelling, inference, recommendation, and analysis has been worked out and evaluated in both hospitals and communities. The project has been ranked first among all the national \u201c863\u201d projects in the medical IT fields by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China in 2009.\xa0 The success has led to a new \u201c863\u201d project of \u201cMedical Knowledge Base and Clinical Decision Support System\u201d initiated from Jan. 2011.\xa0\xa0 ', u'\r\n', u'Development of ', u'integrated ', u'EMR-S', u' in China.', u' From June 2006 to June 2008, as the leader of a R&D team of over 40 researchers and engineers, Dr. Lu was in charge of developing the first integrated EMR-S in China funded by the Chinese Central Military Commission. The pilot has been implemented in Chinese PLA General Hospital. The system has been entered the mass market in China and been implemented in over 30 hospitals in China so far. The success has led to a new \u201c863\u201d project of \u201cHigh-end Electronic Medical Record System and its pilot in Hospital\u201d initiated from Jan. 2011.', u'\r\n', u'Development of Integrated Physiology Information System through Knowledge Transfer.', u' From April 2002 to June 2003, Dr. Lu worked in Nihon Kohden Corporation (NKC) of Japan as a visitor. During this period, Dr. Lu proposed the development of an integrated physiology information system and created an architectural design based on his knowledge and experience in healthcare IT. The collaboration between ZJU and NKC has been established after Dr. Lu return China and finally the system was released in 2006. It has been applied in more than 300 hospitals thus far, and won the first market share in Japan. \xa0', u'\r\n\r\n', u'\r\n', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Medical Informatics, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Healthcare Process Management', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:+86-571-87951792', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:xudonglu@bme.zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':School of Biomedical Engineering & Instrumentation', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/0003440'}
