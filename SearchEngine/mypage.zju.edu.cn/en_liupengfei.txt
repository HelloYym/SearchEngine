He got Ph.d. in Solid Mechanics from Zhejiang University on Jun. 2006 and continues the postdoctoral research in Mechanical Engineering in Zhejiang University from Jun.2006 to Sep.2008, and is currently an Associate Professor at Institute of Process Equipment, Zhejiang University, China. He has published more than 20 english articles on the damage, failure, strength and postbuckling properties as well as optimization for \xa0lightweight composite structures.', u'\r\n', u'Research interests', u' include: micro-macro multiscale progressive failure analysis and optimization of lightweight composite structures; postbuckling and delamination of composite laminates; cohesive modeling for delamination of composite laminates; Virtual crack closure technique; (rate-dependent) damage/plasticity coupling constitutive model; strain localization and strong and weak discontinuity problems; extended finite element method for arbitrary crack growth; genetic algorithm for optimal design; nondestructive test using acoustic emission.', u'\r\n', u'Dr. Pengfei Liu has completed a research project of Chinese National Natural Science Funding (Number:50905157). He developed a multiscale damage and failure model for lightweight composite laminates relating the macroscopic to microscopic mechanical performance. Currently, he is studying the micro-macro multiscale mechanical properties of lightweight composite laminates under the support of Chinese Natural Science Funding\xa0(Number: 51375435) and Zhejiang Natural Science Funding\xa0(Number: LY13E050002).', u'\r\n', u'During the period of visiting scholar at Princeton University, he proposes an original theory for predicting the strong discontinuity of strain localization of non-associative plasticity materials by extended finite element method\xa0by collaborating with\xa0Prof. Jean H. Prevost.
