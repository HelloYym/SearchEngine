He gives lectures on "Genetics", \u201cIntroduction to Modern Genetics\u201d and "Crop Breeding Science" to undergraduate students and lectures to graduate students on "Quantitative Genetics", "Advances in Crop Science" and "Advances in Crop Breeding ". His research areas mainly include the studies of genetic mechanisms responsible for agronomic and seed quality traits in rice, rapeseed, cotton, Chinese kale or stevia; molecular mapping of seed quality traits; the application of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy to crop quality analysis; utilization for the heterosis of hybrid rice; germplasm enhancement or biotechnology in crop improvement and rice breeding which combines high yield andresistance with good quality. He has released five new rice varieties ("Zhenong 8010", "Zhenong 921", "Zhenong 952", "Zhenong 7" and "Zhenong 34"). Together with his colleague(s) and students, Dr. Shi has published 4 books and\xa0195 refereed papers (82 of which were published in internationally recognized journals).
