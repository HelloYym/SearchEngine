He joined Department of Polymer Science and Engineering in 1998 when Zhejiang University was merged with Hangzhou University and other two universities. Prior to that he was a professor at the Department of Chemistry of Hangzhou University. He is also Professor of Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University. He teaches Polymer Physics course for undergraduate program and Polymer Surface and Interface course for graduate program.', u'\r\n', u'His research interest is in the structure-properties relationship of multi-component polymer systems and the modification of polymeric materials via blending, filling, and compounding. He and his colleagues developed compatibilization-crosslinking synergism technique that could be used to improve the mechanical properties of immiscible polymer blends with high efficiency. In the recent years, his research is concentrated in the development of halogen-free flame retardant plastics, especially those containing P-N compounds and nano-fillers.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Research work', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Structure-properties relationship of multi-component polymer systems;\r\nPolymer nanocomposites;\r\nModification of polymeric materials via blending, filling, and compounding;\r\nEnvironmental friendly flame retardant polymer materials.', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:+86-571-87953712', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:zpfang@zju.edu.cn', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Department of Polymer Science and Engineering', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/zpfang'}
