Before joining InCSI, he was a JSPS research fellow at National Institute for Materials Science, Japan. He was a post-doctoral researcher in Advanced Composite Centre for Innovation and Science at the University of Bristol and Lab-STICC at Universit\xe9 de Bretagne Occidentale. He received the Master of Science in nano-materials from the South China University of Technology in 2007 and Ph.D in multifunctional composites from the\xa0", u'University of Bristol in 2010. He was a recipient of the Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme (ORSAS) and the University of Bristol   Postgraduate Student Scholarship. He was nominated for the Exceptional Thesis Prize and selected as one of the two candidates at Bristol for UK Royal Academy Engineering Fellowship. He was also the awardee of Finist\xe8re Postdoctoral Fellowship in France and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) fellowship.
