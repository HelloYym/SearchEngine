From 1986 to 1989, he worked as a doctoral fellow at the Centre National d\u2019Etudes des T\xe9l\xe9communications, Bagneux,France. From1989 to1993, he was a postdoctoral fellow and then a research associate with Technical University of Nova Scotia (now Dalhousie University), Halifax, Canada, where he worked on semiconductor nonlinear optical devices. He joined the Institute for Microstructural Sciences, National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, Ottawa, Canada in 1994 as a research associate, and later became a tenured Research Officer, working on semiconductor optoelectronic devices for dense-wavelength-division- multiplexing applications. In 2000, he co-founded Canadian photonics start-up company MetroPhotonics and served as the Chief Scientist. He joined the Department of Optical Engineering, Zhejiang University in 2006 as a Changjiang Chair Professor specially appointed by the Chinese Ministry of Education. His current interest is micro/nanostructure-based multifunctional integrated photonic devices for optical communications, biomedical sensing and environmental monitoring. He has published over 200 scientific papers and holds 18 US patents. He served as General Co-Chair of 2011 Asia Communication and Photonics Conference and Exhibition (ACP), and Co-Chair of Technical Program Committee of ACP 2010.
