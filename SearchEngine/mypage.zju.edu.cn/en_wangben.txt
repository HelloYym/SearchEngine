He was a research follow in Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology during 2008-2009, and in Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering during 2009-2010. He has published about 20 papers on the top journal of chemistry, biomaterials (6 papers as first author and 3 papers as corresponding author), that has been cited over 600 times. He was invited to write a review paper and one book chapter about cell surface engineering/biologically interfacial engineering in biomedicine, which illustrated that biologically interfacial engineering had broad applications for metastatic cancer diagnosis and intervention. These research works were highlighted by ACS, RSC, Nature China and Reuters, and also recommended by Faculty of 1000. He was selected as reviewer for series of journals, such as ACS nano, Angew Chem Int Ed, Curr Pharm Des and J Control Release and so on. In 2009, Ben Wang got Leadership Scholarship awarded by Committee of 100 (US).\xa0', u'\r\n', u'Education', u'\r\n', u'09/2006-06/2011 Ph.D. in Chemistry & Biomedical Engineering, Zhejiang University & Harvard University (Joint PhD Program)\xa0', u'\r\n', u'09/2004-06/2006 M.S.
