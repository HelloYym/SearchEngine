He received the B. Sc. degree in theoretical physics from Nanjing University, China in 1999, and received the Master degree from the department of physics of Zhejiang University in 2002. He has been engaged in quantum optics and electromagnetism since 2002, and received the joint PhD from the Royal Swedish Institute of Technology (KTH) and Zhejiang University (optics in Zhejiang University and theoretical electromagnetism in KTH). Jian Qi Shen has published over 100 research papers and book chapters in the areas of optics, artificial electromagnetic materials, quantum theory and gravitation, in which he has studied the topics such as quantum-vacuum geometric phases, quantum-coherent negative refraction, dynamics of topological dual mass, mass spectra of leptons as well as spin-connection gravitational gauge field theory. During the past four years, he has been supported financially by the Postdoctoral Foundations and the National Natural Science Foundations of China. He published a review book entitled "Quantum & Classical Optical Properties of Artificial Electromagnetic Media" (ISBN: 978-81-7895-356-4, Transworld Research Network, India, 2008).
