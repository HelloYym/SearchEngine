', u'Recently I turn my interest to the hypersonic aerodynamics, which might involve in astronautics science. Nowadays interplanetary transit is not dreams only, and throughout the world many research efforts focus on the concept of spacecraft such like pathfinder and problems arising during designing. What I am interested is the numerical simulation method used in the study of hypersonic aero-environment of spacecraft. The numerical method would be an efficient way to model the hypersonic flow around the vehicles and useful way to findout something unknown.
