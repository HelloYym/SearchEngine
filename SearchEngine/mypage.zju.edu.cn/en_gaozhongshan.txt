The major research achievement was the releasing of two new walnut varieties. In year 1997 and 1998, he worked at the Department of Vegetables and Fruit Crops, CPRO-DLO (now incorporated into Plant Research International, Wageningen, The Netherlands) as a visiting scientist. He participated in projects on apple molecular marker linkage mapping and genetic analysis of apple scab resistance. In March 2001 he returned to Plant Research International (PRI) and participated in the EU-SAFE project to map four classes of apple allergen genes on apple molecular marker maps. In 2006, he got a professor position at Department of Horticulture, Zhejiang University.
