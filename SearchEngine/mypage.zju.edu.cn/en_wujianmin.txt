S degree in chemistry from Huzhou Normal College in 1988. From 1988 to 1991, he worked in Hangzhou textile Corp. as a chemistry teacher. From 1991, he began to study electro-analytical chemistry in Department of chemistry, Hangzhou University. His research work for master degree was mainly focused on electrochemical biosensor. In 1994 he received a M.S. degree in chemistry from Hangzhou University. After that, he started his academic work in Zhejiang Agricultural University. His early research interest included: Biochromatography, bio-analysis, and environmental analysis. In 2005 he received a Ph.D in environmental science from Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor Weipin Liu. His Ph.D work involved the separation and identification of Cry1Ab protein express in transgenic plants. In 2006 he became a Professor in the Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University. In 2007-2008, he performed collaborative research works as a visiting scholar in Prof. Sailor\u2019s lab in Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). From 2009, he joined the faculty in the Institute of Microanalytical System (IMAS).
