Based on this project, technological innovations are obtained, including the improvement of property of homebred modified bitumen mix, analysis of non-contact stress in asphalt pavement structure layers, etc., and solved the long-term stability and durability of asphalt pavement in the humid and wet climate of South China. This project has important economical and social values, and the corresponding outcome of this project was considered to be the state-leading, and was awarded the third Prize of Zhejiang provincial Science and Technology in 2005.', u'\r\n\xa0\xa0 2.', u'Experimental investigation of Simply Supported-Continuous Prestressed beam system ', u'(2001.12~2004.7). Based on this project, an innovative structural analysis method was proposed and the corresponding construction innovation technology was created. The outcome of this project was awarded the third Prize of Science and Technology granted by China Highway and Transportation Society\uff08CHTS\uff09in 2005\uff0cand the third Prize of Zhejiang provincial Science and Technology in 2006.', u'\r\n\xa0 3. ', u'Crack-Resistance Performance Research on Cement Stabilized Macadam Subgrade of High-grade Asphalt Pavement ', u'(2005.6~2006.11). A new method using grain particles with large diameters \uff08as large as 53mm\uff09 in the main structure of cement stabilized macadam subgrade was first presented to resolve the cracking issue in semi-rigid base. An excellent crack-resistance mix proportion of cement stabilized macadam was obtained by means of a series of laboratory experiments with various gradation curves. A non-linear finite element contact method based on elasticity and linear fracture mechanics were adopted to analyze drying and temperature induced stresses of the semi-rigid base with large grain diameters and\xa0 different curing time, under the effect of temperature, water content and different working conditions. The outcome of this project was ranked to be the leading place in China.', u'\r\n\xa0 4. ', u'Study on the safety and calamity prevention for long tunnel asphalt pavement ', u'(2005.3~2007.3). The combustion division range of the asphalt pavement in fire process was obtained by thermo-gravimetric analysis. The self-ignition temperatures and the heat-releasing rates of the modified asphalt, flame-retarded asphalt and asphalt mortars were obtained by the TG and DTG curves. The direct combustion testing in laboratory and valuation method were proposed for the asphalt pavement in the long highway tunnel. Based on the chemical dynamics and the thermodynamics, a three-dimensional mathematical model capable of describing the fuel combustion, smoke flow and heat transfer in a tunnel fire was developed, and the accuracy of this mathematic model was validated by the scaled model tests in laboratory. The methodology\xa0 and achievements of this study are again world-leading.', u'\r\n', u'Publications\uff1a', u'\r\n\xa0 (1)Subgrade and Pavement Engineering\uff0czhejiang technological publishing company, china, Apr. 2002,Composed\xa0 by Z.Y.
