He became Assistant professor in 1998 and associate professor in 2003.  Since Sept. 2011, he has been a visiting scholar in the X-ray scattering group at Brookhaven National Lab.\r\nHis scientific interests are in investigating the relationship between the local structure and physical properties in nano-crystals and iron-based semiconductors using advanced x-ray technique and the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) method, and in relationship between the structure and bioactivity of new antitumor metal complex based on quinolones. On the technical side, his interests include structural analysis using the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)  and Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) methods.\r\n', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'        \t\t', u'\n\t\t\t', u'Contact', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t\tPhone:86-571-87952807', u'\n\t\t\tE-mail:chewanggp@zju.edu.cn, chewanggp@gmail.com', u'\n\t\t\t', u'\n\t\t', u'\n        \t\t\t\n\t'], 'department': u':Institute of Physical Chemistry,Zhejiang University', 'homepage': 'http://mypage.zju.edu.cn/en/0096025'}
