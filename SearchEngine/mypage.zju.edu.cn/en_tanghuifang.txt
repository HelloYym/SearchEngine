I join a research group \u2013 Zhejiang respiratory drug research laboratory within the Department of Pharmacology. In addition I have close collaborative relationships with other groups both medical school and outside of the Zhejiang university. My research, both past and present, has been in the area of respiratory system. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) is any enzyme that breaks a phosphodiester bond. The cyclic nucleotide PDEs comprise a group of enzymes that degrade the phosphodiester bond in the second messenger molecules cAMP and cGMP. They regulate the localization, duration, and amplitude of cyclic nucleotide signaling within subcellular domains.The PDE superfamily of enzymes is classified into 11 families, namely PDE1-PDE11, in mammals. PDE enzymes are often targets for pharmacological inhibition due to their unique tissue distribution, structural properties, and functional properties. PDE inhibitors have been identified as new potential therapeutics in areas such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, dementia, depression, and schizophrenia. My previous work has focused on the identifying the role of PDE4 in respiratory disease through studying the expression of mRNA and protein, the activity of cAMP-PDE and cGMP-PDE. I have generated serial animal model for research respiratory system disease and intend to extend this work to study the effect of new drugs. In addition, I have studied the siRNA plasmid transfer into related cell to inhibit the expression of PDE4, then study the role of PDE4 in the cell signaling including TLRs receptors, and intracellular proteins. My current interest is to developing systems based approaches to understand PDE4 and to generate and test novel hypothesis concerning the PDE4-intracellular protein interaction in this context. I believe that a detailed understanding of PDE4 will provide insights into the role of PDE in remodeling inflamed tissue and in the innate and adaptive immune responses.
