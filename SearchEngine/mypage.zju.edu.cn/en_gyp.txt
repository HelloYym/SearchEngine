Some of my projects have continued for more than a quarter century, investigating long-term impacts and aspects of fruit tree physiology. Current research areas include photosynthetic capture and photorespiratory release of CO2, the goal of this research is to determine and modify the biochemical and regulatory factors that impact photosynthetic capture and photorespiratory release of CO2. Developmental and environmental limitations to photosynthesis and metabolism. The aim of this research is to analyze the limitations and environmental factors that influence photosynthetic productivity at the whole plant and canopy levels. Particular emphasis will be placed on temperature stresses and nitrogen use. This work will integrate understanding to optimize photosynthetic production, yield and quality form under current and future environmental conditions. In fruit trees plants, Rubisco catalyzes the fixation of atmospheric CO2 into organic acids, in the end, form serviceable important substance. Detail investigation of the molecular mechanisms controlling the unique ability of rare species of resurrection plants to withstand high temperature, will help us define the exact genetic and metabolic requirements for high temperature tolerance.Water physiology in fruit trees.
